Mudlet scripts for Nukefire: Beyond Thunderdome

tdome.nukefire.org:4000

# Installation

Download [package](https://github.com/...)

# Configuration

Configure the following variables to match your setup

- tank
- healer
- dps

Make sure the option to enable MSDP is checked on each of your profiles (it's not by default)

# Assumptions

- You're running things from one window (the tank)

# Developing

While you're free to make any customizations in Mudlet's editor directly, I prefer to work in an IDE.

IDE Setup:

Requires [muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler)
Optionally requires [DeMuddler](https://github.com/Edru2/DeMuddler/) if you want to export your existing mudlet triggers, scripts, aliases, etc.
